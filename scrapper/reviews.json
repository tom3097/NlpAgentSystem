The USB-C ports can act as the power-jack which is convenient when your power plug is sometimes on the left and sometimes on the right.  Unfortunately, if you're charging the machine, this leaves you with only one remaining USB-C port.

I velcro it to the back of the screen and remove it when I'm using the device in tablet mode (since I usually don't need it wired up in tablet mode).

Thankfully for both of these purchases I was still within the return period and was able to send back to Amazon (considering in both cases they stopped charging quickly).

The screen is really amazing and you can easily change it to 1080p with no issues (it's set lower out of the box). It can even simulate 2K in the OS but the icons and text become almost too small to read or use. It has a very fast 64GB SSD and 4GB on LPDDR3 memory. The m3 processor (also available as m5 variant) is fast and easily handles anything I throw at it. It is a fanless processor so there are no vents or openings of any kind which makes this exceptionally quiet as well. The touchscreen is very responsive and works great in tablet mode. The device is very light and easily transportable. The battery life is touted as 10 hours but I find that 7.5 to 8 is more realistic. The design of the device also sets it apart.
